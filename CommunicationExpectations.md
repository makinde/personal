# Communication Expectations
You can expect a response from my within these time frames for each medium. All times are business hours (so if you send something just before or on a weekend/holiday, those hours won't count).

- Email: within 48 hrs
- Slack messages: within 24 hrs
- Text messages: within 8 hrs

Please choose a communication channel that suits the level of urgency for your request.

By default, I expect the same from others I work with. If you would like to have different gaurantees, please let me know. That's totally okay.
