# Working with Makinde

_These are tips on how best to work with me_

- There are two ways to work with me, as EXPERT or as a Novice
- Ideas in isolation are hard for me to evaluate. I want to know and agree on what the goal is, and then connect the idea to that
- Deliver or renegotiate commitments
- Show me that you know what’s *not* going well. The worse the better. Then I know that you are aware enough to notice them. Even better, show me that you have ideas on how to fix them.
    - Showing me a status update with only good news makes me suspicious that you’re hiding the bad, or worse yet, don’t know know what’s going wrong.
- When I ask a question, answer it directly. There might be other info that’s relevant, but if you lead with that, I’m still wondering the answer to my question. Answer the question first, then add things.
- If you’re not sure exactly what is meant by a goal or an ask, ask a question. Silently ignoring the ask erodes my trust very quickly. Even if you disagree, telling me that lets me know that you heard it and think otherwise. If you ignore it, I don’t know what to think (disagreement? miscommunication? intentionally missing?)
- I am goal anchored. When evaluating something I look at the delta from the goal that was set, not in the total value generated.
    - Perhaps strengths based vs deficit based approach
- I think in frameworks. I try to fit everything into a simple framework or set of guidelines. If you suggest something and I can't figure out the framework, I'll try to understand that first. Instead of one off's, share your framework for thinking about something, then the specific idea.
- I tend to move things forward by finding what's not working and fixing that. Lots of people like to find what is working and double down on that.
